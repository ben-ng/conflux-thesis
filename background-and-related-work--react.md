# React

React is a library for building user interfaces declaratively. After programmers declare what the current user interface should look like, React figures out what has changed, and applies those changes in a performant way. This simplifies the construction of complex user interfaces. User interfaces that are built with React are like pure functions that take the application state as input and return a functioning interface as output.
