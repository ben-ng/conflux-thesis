# React

React is a library for building user interfaces declaratively. After programmers declare what the current user interface should look like, React figures out what has changed, and applies those changes in a performant way. User interfaces that are built with React are like pure functions that take the application state as input and return a functioning interface as output. This simplifies the construction of complex user interfaces, because there are none of the side-effects or nondeterminism that is typical of imperatively constructed user interfaces.
