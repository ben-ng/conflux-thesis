# Examples

The following examples show how Conflux simplifies thinking about distributed systems. Instead of describing algorithms using RPC calls or message passing, we describe them using methods, actions, and reducers. Since methods and reducers are synchronous, it is simple to verify that they are correct.

To show that Conflux is not just useful in theory, each example is accompanied by a working demonstration. To see how straightforward it is to translate the pseudocode into a functioning system, take a look at the attached source code.
