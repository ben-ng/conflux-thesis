# Conflux

Conflux is an abstraction for shared memory that makes it easier to design consistent distributed systems. It is based on the [Redux](http://redux.js.org) adaptation of the [Flux architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html), and uses the [Raft consensus algorithm](http://raft.github.io).

Conflux helps you build distributed systems that are predictable and run in different environments. It can coordinate multiple processes on the same machine, a cluster of backend servers, or even web pages opened on different devices.

This book is my thesis, and explores the abstract ideas behind Conflux. A reference implementation of Conflux can be found [here](https://github.com/ben-ng/conflux).
